I'm Thomas, I'm a developer and like to make pretty things on the web.

Currently I'm working as a front-end developer at [Mr. Henry 🏀](https://www.mrhenry.be/).

I'm available for side projects, you can contact me on my [email 📬](mailto:info@thomasverleye.be).

My main interests at the moment are creating websites which are:
- Accessible for everyone ✌️
- Neatly organised and expandable 🤓
- Not depending on any fancy new framework 💊
- Progressive enhancements makes the web a better place 🌈
- Keeping things thight with the web standards 🔜

Some random facts:
- I have a very wide view on the music scene, follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/116726019?si=u73R7xvsTLWo0lmlH2suBw) and listen to some of my playlists (and please share me yours).
- I've got alot of tattoos.
- I can get really obsessed with `<picture>` tags and `srcset`'s (I really do).
- The cuddle lion I share with my girlfriend is called “Lola”.
- Github should drop their contract with ICE.
