I'm Thomas, I'm a developer and like to make pretty things on the web.

Currently I'm working as a front-end developer at [Craftzing ⚡️](https://craftzing.com/).<br>
I'm available for side projects, you can contact me on my [email 📬](mailto:thomas@gimmechaos.dev).<br>
Follow me on [dev.to ⌨️](https://dev.to/thomasverleye) and read my toots on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@thomasverleye">Mastodon</a>.

My main interests at the moment are creating websites which are:
- Accessible for everyone ✌️
- Neatly organised and expandable 🤓
- Progressive enhancements makes the web a better place 🌈

Some random facts:
- I have a very wide view on the music scene, follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/116726019?si=u73R7xvsTLWo0lmlH2suBw) and listen to some of my playlists.
- I've got a lot of tattoos.
- I can get really obsessed with `<picture>` tags and `srcset`'s (I really do).
- The cuddle lion I share with my girlfriend is called “Lola”.
- Github should drop their contract with ICE.
