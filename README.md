I'm Thomas, I'm a developer and like to make pretty things on the web.

Currently I'm working as a head of front at [Craftzing ⚡️](https://craftzing.com/).  
I'm available for side projects, you can contact me on my [email 📬](mailto:thomas@gimmechaos.dev).

My main interests at the moment are creating websites which are:
- Accessible for everyone ✌️
- Neatly organised and expandable 🤓
- Progressive enhancements makes the web a better place 🌈
